 Created as a temporary work around for the Google+ Platform's
 lack of support for selecting a count of plus ones for a given url.
 Inspired by my team at Zeit Online ( specifically @venohr and @hwy395 )
 and the Google+ Platform team that wrote https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js
 as well as the source that it embeds.

 You can find the google-plus-platform issue #57 at
 http://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=57

 You can find a blog post furter explaining the creation of this script at
 http://blog.colegillespie.com/2012/03/05/number-of-plus-ones-for-any-url/
 
 Instructions to get started ( from a machine with node.js and npm installed ):
   git clone git://github.com/coleGillespie/google-plus-platform-utils.git
   npm install jsdom
   node plusOnes
